## Description

Using a grid layout is an appealing way to introduce your professional and friendly teaching staff to prospective parents. The format allows space for welcoming text above the biographies and the use of a sizeable portrait image of each teacher. Buttons can be centered under each image to allow visitors to click and view detailed information on the member of the faculty on another page.
