## Description

As a design element, a full-size image on a web page is an appealing and illustrative part of the layout. A well-chosen large image will play an important role in engaging your audience, as it will entice a reader to keep reading, and can explain a subject in a quick glance. Using this image component will allow you to bring life to your page, but make sure you always consider the ratio of the space available on screen, when choosing your source image.

## Using the Body Layout Component


1. Open a WPBakery Frontend Editor on the page you want to modify
2. Click the + symbol on the top menu to open the component menu
3. Navigate to the section Next-Gen
4. Find the "CTA component" and click the option


## Pro Tip
> When choosing a source photo avoid ones that are tightly framed so that you wonâ€™t lose any key elements if you have to crop and rescale the image.
