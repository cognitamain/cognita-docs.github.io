## Description

A slider is a great component to use on a webpage to display a series of logos or images. Content displayed in a slider will add vibrancy to your site, help your organisation look more appealing, and engage your readers. Users benefit from this type of presentation as images and information are collated in one place, and sliders are easy to navigate.
