## Description

It can often be difficult to engage a visitor to a webpage when it contains a large amount of information, so it’s important to organise content to be user-friendly and not overwhelming to the reader. This has been designed to highlight important links. The border container increases the visibility and importance of the link, yet its simplistic design allows it to be included in graphic heavy pages unlike image cards which may overwhelm visitors on your page. The layout allows for the inclusion of helpful overview text and easy-to-view lists of buttons that link to other pages on the website or to an external resource.
