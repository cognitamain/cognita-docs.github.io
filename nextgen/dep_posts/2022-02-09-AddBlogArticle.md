## Description

Blogs are great for driving traffic to your website. Prospective parents and guardians can be inspired to read a blog via an internet search on a subject, or after seeing an interesting post on social media. Ensure that the format of your blogs will continue to engage the user to read on! Use this details component to create the ideal layout for the blogs on your website so that you can include section headers and suitable illustrative images.

Adding a blog post is also a custom post type like Testimonials or Our Teachers but it has more flexibility to modify the post page in the same way as a site page. To access the posts area navigate to the admin area (wp-admin) and find the menu item ‘Posts’.
