## Description

Use this effective grid component to create an appealing collage of images of your school. Prospective students, parents, and guardians can form a genuine impression of the type of community, facilities, and services you offer from viewing a page that incorporates pictures of school life. Individual galleries can be created for different departments and classrooms and linked together to provide a great showcase of your faculty.
