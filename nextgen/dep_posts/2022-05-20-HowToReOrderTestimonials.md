## Description

The testimonials have some limitations when managing the order. The default order is by date, if your teacher was added last then it will appear first on the list. You may want to re-order the testimonials to prioritise a particular post, the best way to do this is to duplicate testimonial by creating a new one and copying the content over. The new post will appear last in the list, and you can remove the original post.

You can edit any of the slider posts and switch the order between ASC and DESC to organise the posts in the order you need.
