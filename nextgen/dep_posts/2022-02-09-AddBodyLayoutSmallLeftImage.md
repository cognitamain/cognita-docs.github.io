## Description

Aligning a series of small images to the left side of a page is a simple way to design a page with a lot of text content, and provide easy readability for a visitor. This helpful image component will allow you to format headings, subheadings, and body text, together with a number of images, to create engaging and interesting page layouts. Good content to include on this kind of page includes company logos or small profile pictures.
