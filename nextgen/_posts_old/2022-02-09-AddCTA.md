## Description

A call to action component can be used to drive traffic to key landing pages like "Open Days" or "Enquiry forms". The key to a powerful call to action is to provide visitors with compelling reasons to click the button. Using a title you can pose a question that resonates with your audience and then using imperative verbs for the button text such as “Book a Tour”, “Download Now”, and “Learn More” you can encourage your visitors to navigate to the pages that drive conversion.
