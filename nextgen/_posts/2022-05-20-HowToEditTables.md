## Description

Tables can be quite difficult to manage on a website, they don't format very well on responsive devices and the larger the table the more complicated it can be to manage the data. 

The next-gen websites instead use the text box wysiwyg editor, this make copying table content from MSWord or google docs very easy, just highlight your table and copy and paste it into the editor. If you want to keep the same heading styles copy your table out of the editor and paste it into word or google docs and modify your table. Once you changes have been made copy it back into the editor and your previous table styles will remain.
