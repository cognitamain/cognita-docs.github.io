## Description

Components like the menu, the footer or even lead forms contain school information like the admissions phone number, contact email addresses, instead of editing this content in multiple locations. We have set up global options to store this information allowing you to make changes in a single location and the website will update wherever that content is used.

To update these details navigate to the admin section (wp-admin) towards the bottom of the menu you should notice the menu item Next-Gen Options. 

Open the definitions section, here you can update the any of your global site definitions and your site will automatically update these details where they have been used.
