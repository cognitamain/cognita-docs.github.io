## Description

When you want to add vibrancy and improve the readability of a message or instruction on a page, include a full-size background image and the text will immediately pop! A background image will create a good contrast against the text on the page, which will also improve the design and aesthetic appeal of the website.

2. Click the + symbol on the top menu to open the component menu

## Pro Tip
> Choosing an image that clearly illustrates the subject matter at hand, will also reinforce and speed up the delivery of your message.
