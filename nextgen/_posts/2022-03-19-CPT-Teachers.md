## Description

For types of content that follow a similar structure Wordpress allows us to create a custom post type to manage this content. For Our Teachers we have created the custom post type Teachers. To access the area open the admin area (wp-admin) and click on the Teachers item on the left menu.

The teacher management page allows you to view all the current teacher records. You can edit an existing record or add a new Teacher record.
