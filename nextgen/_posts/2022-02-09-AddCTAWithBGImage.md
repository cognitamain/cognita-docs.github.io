## Description

The Call to action (CTA) content on a website is one of the most vital marketing tools for any organisation; the background of CTA content is one of the most important elements of the CTA. When the background of a CTA ensures the CTA stands out on a page then the user will focus more on its message and will be more likely to engage. This image component is a great way to make your CTA buttons or forms a prominent part of any page design. By choosing a good photographic image you will not only bring vibrancy to the CTA but also a helpful illustration of the subject matter.

## Pro Tip
> Be concisely creative with the text you use on your CTA buttons. One word CTAs are often boring so avoid: submit, enter, call etc… Think of more enticing instructions such as: Book a tour, Take a virtual tour etc…
