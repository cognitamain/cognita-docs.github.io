## Description

The Donut Chart has succeeded the Pie Chart when it comes to successfully displaying statistics on a website. A Donut Chart is basically a Pie Chart with a blank area at its centre. Unlike the Pie Chart, which can make it difficult for a viewer to differentiate between its slices, a Donut Chart focuses the eye on the length of a graphic arc and provides clearer information. Highlight important statistics and capture your audiences attention with animated charts.
