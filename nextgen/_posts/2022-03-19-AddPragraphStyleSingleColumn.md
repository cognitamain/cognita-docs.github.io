## Description

The single-column layout is a simple and effective way of using text on a page that includes a large image or video. Use the Body Text - single column with image component to include helpful and concise copy to support an illustrative image so that visitors will quickly understand the message you wish to convey.

{% include image.html img="body_text_1_col_settings.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="Alt for image" caption="Body Text Single Settings" %}


## Using the Paragraph Style Component


1. Open a WPBakery Frontend Editor on the page you want to modify
2. Click the + symbol on the top menu to open the WPBakery component menu
3. Navigate to the section Next-Gen
4. Select the option Paragraph Style - Single column Image
5. The settings box will open out, add the title and paragraph content
6. By default the component will create a grid of four, two rows of two columns
7. Complete only the first two tabs if you want one row of two columns
9. Continue through the other tabs populating the content
10. Click save the component will be added to the end of the page
11. You can drag it to the right place in your page by selecting the left corner of the row



## Pro Tip
> The old & international adage "A picture is worth a thousand words" sums up how a single image can sometimes impart a meaning or idea more effectively than descriptive words.
