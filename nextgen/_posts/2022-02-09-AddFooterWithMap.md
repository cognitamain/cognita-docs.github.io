## Description

This is a smart design component to help create the ideal footer for your web pages. Underneath the overview text is a list of quick links to important information contained within subpages and a row of icons to direct the user to social media platforms. The contact information is formatted on a different colour background to the footer to help it stand out, and it includes a map to help viewers confirm your location, always helpful content for a school campus.



## Using the Footer Component


1. Open a WPBakery Frontend Editor on the page you want to modify
2. Click the + symbol on the top menu to open the component menu
3. Navigate to the section Next-Gen
4. Find the "CTA component" and click the option


## Pro Tip
> When you include a sitemap in a footer it not only helps the user navigate your website, it also allows you to provide additional links to your subpages, and it will also support SEO!
