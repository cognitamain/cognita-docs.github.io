## Description

Are there a lot of great things that you want to tell your audience about your faculty? This video component is the ideal format to use when you have a tonne of good video content but limited screen space to host it all: an impressive school campus, inspiring teaching practices, an interactive drama class, fun sports activities, happy classrooms & playgrounds - use video layout in a grid to showcase the best aspects of your school.
