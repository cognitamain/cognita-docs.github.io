## Description

A sliding hero banner allows you to increase the content available above the fold. We would recommend that the auto-slide is disabled as unexpected changes in content can cause a bad user experience.

To manage sliding hero banner we use a plugin called Slider Revolution. Slider Revolution is a flexible tool that allows users to create quite complicated sliders in the admin area. Users can manage the slides, how each slider animates, add buttons and titles all from within the Slider Revolution workspace. Once you have created your slider to add it to the page open up WPBakery, add a Slider Revolution element and select the slider you created. Your slides may not be visible in WPBakery but after positioning the element preview the page to make sure it is working as expected.
