## Description

The pop up component allows you to reduce the text content on the page by only showing a brief description on the page and opening out to the full details inside a dialogue box. From a users perspective it makes the content more manageable and easier to find other content if this content is not what they are looking for.

This component is ideal for testimonials or key messages you want to share with you visitors.
