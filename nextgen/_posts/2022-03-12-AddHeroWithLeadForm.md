## Description

This header image component is a simple yet effective way to encourage your audience to start interacting with your product or services. This type of content can work in several positive ways: providing an image that illustrates exciting or helpful information; copy that encourages the visitor to read further; a form to entice the visitor to make contact and ask for more information.
