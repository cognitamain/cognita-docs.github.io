## Description

Creating a landing page is the same as creating another page on your site. However we don’t usually include a menu on a landing page as it distracts visitors and reduces the conversion rate. When you create a page you can define the default template under Page Attributes -> Template, for Landing pages set this to the Landing Page template.
