## Description

The card graphic format on a website allows you to communicate information to your reader in a smart and concise way. Cards often feature simple content: an image accompanied by a name, title, user name, and icons. Each individual card can work as a mini condensed web page, and they are a great way to promote products and services. This 4 column card component is formatted to centre 4 cards across the width of a web page in a clear reader-friendly design layout.
