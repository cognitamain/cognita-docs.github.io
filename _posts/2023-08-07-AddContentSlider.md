## Description

A Content slider is a great component to use on a webpage to display a images with links for any publications. The content displayed in the slider will bring vitality to your site, helping your readers to easily navigate to the relevant publication. Users benefit from this type of feature as images and information are collated in one place, and by keeping the sliders stationary it is easy to use them separately without moving images.
