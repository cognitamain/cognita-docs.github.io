## Created And Add Events In Event Data

- If this is a new setup to add events then click on the plus icon to open the accordion.
- Enter a valid event name. It is not necessary to use any comma (,) in this field.
   {% include image.html img="event_data1.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="Alt for image" caption="EventData" %}
- Select the event campus, for which option you need to add the event.
- There is no need to add or edit the "Main events shown" field. Since this is just to show where the event created will appear on the form side.
- Add event start date, start time, end date, end time to the event. Note*: End time should be greater than start time.
   {% include image.html img="event_data2.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="Alt for image" caption="EventData" %}
- To add another event, click the "Add Event" button and follow the same steps.
- Save the event with "Save Changes".

## Link Pre-Created Event
- In "Event Name" enter the same event name as created/exists in CRM Marketing side.
   {% include image.html img="crm_event_name.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="Alt for image" caption="Get CRM Event Name" %}
- TFill in all the event details and save the changes.
   {% include image.html img="add_crm_event_name.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="Alt for image" caption="add_crm_event_name" %}

## Verify Events On Form
- Open the Front End Side form and select the campus for which the events were added from the CMS side.
- On selecting an option there will be a dropdown and we can verify the event name in the option.
  like in below screenshot:
  {% include image.html img="event_verification_onform.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="Alt for image" caption="event_verification_onform" %}

## See The registered users in CRM.

- After successful form submission we can see the record in CRM Marketing Events section
   {% include image.html img="records_in_crm.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="Alt for image" caption="records_in_crm" %}
   
   



## Pro Tip
> The value of the event end time must be greater than the start time. If there is any need to link pre-created events, the event name should match with the events in the CRM marketing side for the relevant event.
