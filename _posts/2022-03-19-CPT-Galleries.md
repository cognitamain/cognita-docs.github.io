## Description

Galleries allow us to easily organise photos into collections. This is used specifically for the tabbed Masonry gallery and can be used to group different ASA activities, event photos or even to create galleries specific to different campuses. To access the area open the admin area (wp-admin) and click on the Galleries item on the left menu.

Each Gallery photo should be added as a single record. To add a photo click on the Add Galleries button.


## Adding a Testimonial

1. Click Add New Galleries. 
2. In the title section describe the image
3. On the right side of the page you will see the item featured image, here you should add your image.
4. The categories section allows us to filter and organise our posts into groups.
5. If the category type does not exist, create a new category
6. When adding a category, you can choose for the new category name to be organised as a child of an already existing category.
7. To add the record you will need to click publish.
8. After you publish the record you will see the new record in any existing Our Teachers components where the categories have been set up to match.

## Pro Tip
> Organise you campuses on the top level and then sub categories can include sports or activities specific to that campus.
