## Description

Parents moving children from one International School to another can get confused by the different grade systems used by the schools. If a parent can identify which grade their child will be part of they will be closer on the journey to making a buying decision.

The grade calculator can automatically calculate the Childs grade based on the month and birth that the parent enter. This component is interactive and can be used on any page to encourage parents to engage with it.
