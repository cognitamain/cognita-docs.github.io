## Description

Wordpress WPBakery elements are contained in rows on the page. The very first row on your web page is used to contain your header image.

To Edit your header image open up your page in WPBakery hover over the current header and you will see a label with Row Column appear in the top left corner. Click the arrow in the Row label to expand it and then click the pencil icon to open Row Settings.

The row settings panel will open out in a new box, navigate to Design Options. You will see the current image used, to replace it simply click the red ‘X’ and click the ‘+’ symbol that appears after you delete the original image. The media library opens up and you can select an existing or upload a new image.

Remember to Save Changes after you have selected your new image, and you will need to click update in the top right corner for your page changes to take effect.


## Pro Tip
> You can align the image using WPBackend editor in Classic Mode, you will need to edit the background-position in the text to Top, Center or Bottom  of the very first image.
