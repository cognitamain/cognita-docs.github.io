## Description

You can easily maximize the readability and function of header text by using the lists with icons component. This design format ensures the best use of screen space, an agreeable reading layout, and aesthetically pleasing icons that are user touch-friendly. Icons add appeal to any design and users can recognise their functionality or subject matter quickly.

## Using the Paragraph Style Component

1. Open a WPBakery Frontend Editor on the page you want to modify
2. Click the + symbol on the top menu to open the WPBakery component menu
3. Navigate to the section Next-Gen
4. Select the option Paragraph Style - List with Icons
5. The settings box will open out, ignore (leave empty) the first fields icon title and title
6. For each item you want to add in the list select an icon and add text
8. Continue through the other tabs populating the content
9. Click save the component will be added to the end of the page
10. You can drag it to the right place in your page by selecting the left corner of the row


## Pro Tip
> Icons are truly international! Itâ€™s unlikely you will ever need a translation for an icon :)
