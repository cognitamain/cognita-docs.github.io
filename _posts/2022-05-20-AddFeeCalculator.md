## Description

Looking for the fees section on a website is an important buying signal. Parents are familiar with this data when formatted in a table but sometimes seeing all of the different fees for each year can be overwhelming. Some parents can also be confused by the different grade year names making it more difficult for them to find the answers they are looking for.

The automatic fee calculator organises these fees by age and grade. This allows parents to look up their childs age and find out the relevant grade a school fee getting the parent to the answer they are looking for more quickly.
