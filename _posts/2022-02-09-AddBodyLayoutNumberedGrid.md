## Description

This graphic component is a smart way to number and set out the steps to be taken, or points to follow, regarding an action or subject you wish to convey to a user. The clear numbering system is an ideal way to highlight the positives of your educational services or to show a prospective parent or guardian how to apply online for a place at school.

## Pro Tip
> bullet point .v. number? In general, bulleted lists are used when points do not have to be in a specific order & numbered lists should be applied when items need to be in order, such as action steps or timelines.
