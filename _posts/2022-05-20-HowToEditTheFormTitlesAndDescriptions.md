## Description

After adding a lead form component you may want to add details on what leads are registering for. We have provided 4 fields a title and description included on the left, and a title a description specific to the form. We would recommend adding any list details on the form description.

{% include image.html img="lead_form_section_settings.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="Alt for image" caption="Lead form settings" %}
