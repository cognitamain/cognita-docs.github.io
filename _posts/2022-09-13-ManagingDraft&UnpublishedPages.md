## Description

When you are working on a new page it is possible to set the Publish Status to Draft. This will allow logged in users to preview the page for approval before end users are able to see it on your website.

When you are ready to publish the new page, simply go to Pages in the admin area and find and edit the page you want to publish. On the right side of the page you will notice the Publish settings with two buttons Save Draft to apply your changes without publishing or Publish.
