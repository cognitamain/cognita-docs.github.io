## Description

A page dedicated to FAQs (frequently asked questions) can be extremely beneficial to a large organisation or a school. Working as a customer service tool it will filter, field, and answer a lot of questions quickly, which is a good thing for both the user and your admin and admissions departments! FAQs help users to navigate a website and by providing quick answers to questions, they definitely help improve user experience. This 1 column FAQs component is formatted with an Accordion layout, where answers are hidden until the user clicks on the question.
