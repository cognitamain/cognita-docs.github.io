## Description

This image component will provide a vital visual impact to keep visitors on the page, and interested to read more. Make sure you choose an interesting image that will work well as a background to any copy you intend to include in the header. Always check the quality of the image when the page is live, a pixelated or distorted image will have a negative impact on most readers.
