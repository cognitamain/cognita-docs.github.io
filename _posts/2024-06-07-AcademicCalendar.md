## Description
This functionality is useful for displaying List wise and Month wise Events on the Calendar View.


## Enable and Manage Events 

- For the initial implementation, There is a admin menu called Events from where we can add event categories ,events itself as per added categories. There is a setting option as well to handle with the Calendar View settings.
   {% include image.html img="events_admin_menu.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="Alt for image" caption="events_admin_menu" %}

## Add/Edit Events

- There are two ways by using which we can add events. One is single events and second is for importing multiple event in one go.

## Add Event Category
- Add event categories from here as shown below :
{% include image.html img="add_event_category.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="show_events_settings" caption="add_event_category" %}


## Add Single Event

- By using this option below we can add events one by one also category can be assigned from right hand side as shown in screenshot below.
   {% include image.html img="add_event.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="show_events_settings" caption="add_event" %}

## Import Bulk Events 

- Plugin provides an option to import bulk events in one go , it asks us to upload a csv file having proper events data added to it.
   {% include image.html img="import_events.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="show_events_settings" caption="import_bulk_events" %}

- After Importing the csv file ,events data needs to be mapped with exact dropdown heading , and category can also be selected as shown in below:
    {% include image.html img="import_event_mappings.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="show_events_settings" caption="event_mappings" %}
   
- There are some settings as well with which we can modify calendar view 
   {% include image.html img="events_settings.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="show_events_settings" caption="event_settings" %}

   



## Pro Tip
> Prior to adding any events, it's essential to prepare a proper format csv file before importing it . Once the file is completely ready then proceed to import so that calendar view will be absolutely correct.
