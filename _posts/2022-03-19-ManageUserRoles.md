## Description

Every now and then you will need to add or remove users from your website team, but managing individual permissions can be overly complicated. The application simplifies the process by organising permissions into user roles. To manage the users and roles navigate to the admin area (wp-admin) and find ‘Users’ in the left menu. 

From the users section you can see all of the users that have access to the site. You can remove users or reset passwords from this page by clicking the check box next to the user and using the Bulk Actions dropdown menu.

4. Set the level of access the user should have by defining the role
