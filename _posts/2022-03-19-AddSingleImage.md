## Description

Sometimes you just want to add an image and do not need one of the stylised components in the Next-Gen library. WPBakery has its own components that you can use. 


## Using the Single Image Component

1. In the WPBakery editor of your page
2. Click the ‘+’ icon in the top right corner
3. Use the text search to find ‘Single Image’
4. The Single Image Settings box will open out
5. Click the ‘+’ icon under the Image to select the image you want to use in the media library
6. You can specify the size in the Image size input
7. You can apply predefined image styles in Image style dropdown
8. Click Save settings to apply your changes
9. You will need to drag the image to the right place in the page by clicking on the further left row icon and dragging it up and down the page.

## Pro Tip
> The old & international adage "A picture is worth a thousand words" sums up how a single image can sometimes impart a meaning or idea more effectively than descriptive words.
