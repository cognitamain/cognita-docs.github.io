## Description

The performance of you website generally refers to how quick your website loads for end users, this is different for users that have fast internet connection or who are using desktop computers vs users using 3G on mobile devices. A mobile takes more time to process the content on the page and tend to have slower connection speeds. When we test the performance of the sites we need to consider users using mobile devices.

One quick way of increasing the performance of your website is reducing the amount of sections/components on the page as the more sections you have the more processing the site needs to do before the page loads.

This will have varying effect, if the section is predominantly text then it will have little impact on page load performance. But if you are using lots of galleries or testimonial sliders where the content loads in the background, then simplifying the page by reducing the usage of these will see performance gains.

We would recommend not exceeding between 5-10 sections on a page to keep the page load speed optimised.

## Pro Tip

> Even though you are trying to reduce the content for page speed performance, you will still need to have a minimum of 300 words on each page so the SEO performance does not get effected.
