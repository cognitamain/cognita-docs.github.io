## Description

This component is great for breaking up content in you page and drive lead conversions. By choosing a good background image you can hugely increase the inclination of a user to complete a form on your website. An interesting or colourful photographic image can elevate the presence of a simple form on a page, making it easier to notice, read, and complete.
