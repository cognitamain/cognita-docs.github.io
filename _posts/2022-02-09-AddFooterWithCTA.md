## Description

There are few things more useful on a website page than the footer! The purpose of every footer should be to provide important information, navigation options, and links to your visitor. There is no need to explain the use of a footer or direct a user to its location - everyone knows where a footer should be, they are highly visible and your visitors will always scroll to the bottom of your webpage to find the help they need. This footer component is formatted to include calls to actions and links to take the reader directly to what's important to them.


## Using the Footer Component


1. Open a WPBakery Frontend Editor on the page you want to modify
2. Click the + symbol on the top menu to open the component menu
3. Navigate to the section Next-Gen
4. Find the "CTA component" and click the option


## Pro Tip
> Use the practical and enticing space of your footer to include CTA buttons to encourage your visitors to arrange a campus tour, speak to admissions staff, and once again promote your logo!
