## Description

This component can be tricky to edit in WPBakery as the layout gets corrupted. You can use the Backend editor if you feel more comfortable.

A photo gallery showing images of your campus, facilities, and services is the perfect way to document the best aspects of your school community. When images are viewed within a slide show the user is more focused, they can proceed through the gallery at their own pace, and skip content that does not interest them. Use this slide component to display images to provide a quick and enjoyable user experience for visitors.
