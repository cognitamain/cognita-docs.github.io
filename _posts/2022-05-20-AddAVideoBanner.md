## Description

A video banner is a useful tool to reduce your bounce rate as videos can engage audiences as soon as they arrive at your site. This component can be used anywhere on your page not just the header. You can use it to break up text heavy pages or offer more details by providing related video content. The video header component supports videos hosted on Youtube or Vimeo and automatic playback on mobile devices.

## Adding a Video Header component.


1. In the WPBakery editor of your page
2. Click the ‘+’ icon in the top right corner

4. The Video Header Settings box will open out
5. From here add your Vimeo or Youtube URL
6. Set the responsive screen sizes of the video
7. Click Save and the component will be added to the bottom of the page
