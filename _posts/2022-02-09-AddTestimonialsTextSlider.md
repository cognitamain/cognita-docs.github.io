## Description

Having the option to use the only text slider component is a good solution when you want to avoid adding an image that might be restrictive to the content. Testimonial quotes often work well without an image and this kind of slider can be used when screen space is minimal or the inclusion of an image would interfere or distract from the webpage design.
